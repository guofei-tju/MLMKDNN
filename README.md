# MLMKDNN

The MLMKDNN file contains the code of three different type of non-coding RNAs and disease association prediction model(miRNA-disease, circRNA-disease and lncRNA-disease), results of predict evaluation metrics and case study results.

In each type of non-coding RNA code, there two folders in it, one is the data of each type of non-coding RNA and the other is MATLAB codes of the model. The results of predict evaluation metrics are results that compared with other models and case study fold shows the case study results in detail
